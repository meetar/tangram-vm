###vector-map vm setup

After cloning this repository and starting a terminal window inside the directory, the steps below will provision the VM. (You may need to confirm a ssh-authentication step.)

    # start the VM
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh

    # navigate to the shared directory and run the first install script
    cd /vagrant
    bash install1.sh

    # open a new terminal window, ssh back into the vm, and run the second script
    vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant
    bash install2.sh

Test the setup in a browser: <http://localhost:9000/#mapzen>

Note for Windows users: you may need to start the ssh-agent for each new bash session in order for git authentication to work. From outside the vm, run:

    eval `ssh-agent -s` 
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/*_rsa
